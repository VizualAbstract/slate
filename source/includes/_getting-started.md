# The Theme Engine

## About the theme engine

The customer portal is powered by a theme engine which allows you to customize the views to your needs. It is composed of a set of endpoints that provide specific functionality. Each endpoint is associated with a required asset that you can customize to your liking. The endpoint also has a set of objects that can be used to customize the user experience.


Currently in `BETA`, the Theme Engine will be an update to the Customer Portal which will allow you to completely customize the pages their customers use to manage their subscription beyond simply adding HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

You'll have access to use jijna code and an array of objects and filters like Shopify and create a truly unique, personal, and branded experience.
